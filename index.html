         <p>so many people run headlong into panic mode when they find an animal they deem to be injured, orphaned, or otherwise in need of human intervention. The first thing you should do when finding an animal you suspect has been hurt is to gauge the severity of their wounds and decide whether they need you to step in or not. A fox cub who has got into a scrap with a cat and left with a slight scratch on his nose isn’t likely to need emergency rescuing – and chasing him down and grappling him into a crush cage isn’t going to be fun for either of you.But that possum who is panting heavily at the side of the road,looking disoriented,and bleeding from the nostril?<br>THATS YOUR TIME TO SHINE.</p>
